# Ask the stupid questions.          

Those dumb things that you think you don't need to focus on, well they're very important. Constantly ask yourself dumb questions.

1. Who is my audience?
2. What is my content?
3. What do I want them to do?
4. What do they want to do?     

The biggest challenge is not figuring out what questions to ask but learning to ask them in the first place.

## A process, it will die on its own.

The worst pieces of advice come from those who are very good at what they do. I've mastered a few things in my short lifespan and every-time I've gone down wrong roads that people with much greater skills told me to take.

There is a large dichotomy between those who've skills and those who don't. They've forgotten how they got where they are, they've misinterpreted the past with their future knowledge, what they call __insert word for that here__ (damn my brain). 

Many designers speak of their lack of process. This is true, once you become a great designer the process becomes internal & you learn when you can break that process. Sometimes they forget the process was ever there in the first place. If you want to get to that point you've to develop a process and stick to it until you learn it.

I'm a chess expert, I don't think consciously about simple mating maneuvers anymore & haven't for a long time. That doesn't mean that I don't see them, it just means I've internalized those calculations. Internalizing this has freed up my conscious mind for other things.

If you watch a chessmaster play chess very strong some moves will fly instantly as if they're superhuman thinkers, they aren't, they've just internalized a lot of stuff, to the point their brain does it instantly. I highly recommend reading about how chess players think. It may surprise you how they work. Its the same

# Seeing clearly.

Learning to build up a design . Despite what people might tell you human beings aren't very good at keeping much in their mind. We need to internalize things to be effective. If you are conscious of something, its time to focus on it and get it internalized. The details like; what content we are using, the menu items, the colors, the texture of your header etc; they bog down the mind & paralyze it until you cant focuse. When we are focused on small pieces we see clearly what needs to be done.  

## Procrastination   

# Seeing Clearly: Work around the edges     

The greatest enemy of designer is not moving ahead. Its important to keep pushing forward, to build up that knowledge of your own design. 

# Seeing Clearly: shifting perspective.

A twist on the ask the stupid questions. Sometimes its necessary to step back and look at things from a different angle. We get lost in the complexitiy of colors and texturin.    

## Grayscaling it up

Sometimes looking at things in black and white can really help see the contrast.  

## Let it simmer
