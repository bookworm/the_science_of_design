# Contrast = Meaning

# Balance

Visually design needs balance, eyes are drawn areas based on weight. I think grids are never adequately explained to designers. Their purpose is to force balance, but how can you maintain freedom and establish balance? You need to take stock of what each element has & its weight. Turn on grid view & count the number of grids, are they significantly higher in one spot?
